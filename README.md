HotBackup (community)
=====================

The HotBackup API is a specification for a pluggable backup utility.  The
Tokutek patches to MySQL and MariaDB contain hooks for such a utility.

The community edition is the header file that defines the interface to
MySQL, as well as a no-op implementation.
